\section*{Homework 1: Due on February 20 by 5:00 pm}
Instructions. Please follow the homework policy and submission instructions in the Course Information handout. A few highlights to remember:

\begin{itemize}
  \item follow the collaboration and academic honesty policies;
  \item submission is via gradescope (you are encouraged to use LaTeX, using the provided template);
\end{itemize}

Note that, for each bullet item of a problem, you can use the previous bullets as "black box", even if you didn't manage to solve them. Similarly, you can use anything from the lectures as black-box.

\section*{Problem 1}
Suppose you do not want to use the minimum-mean cycle algorithm given in class and in the book, but instead have access to a "Negative Cycle Detection" black box (like Bellman-Ford).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Show that for any real number $\lambda$, the problem of determining if $\mu^{*} \leq \lambda$ can be reduced to the problem of detecting a negative cycle in a modified graph.
  \item Using this reduction, describe an algorithm to find an $\epsilon$-approximate value of $\mu^{*}$ using binary search. What is the range of values for the binary search if all edge weights are integers in $[-W, W]$ ?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem 2}
Show how to find a blocking flow in an acyclic network in $O(n m)$ time by successively augmenting along a path of non-saturated edges and using depth-first search to find such a path. Show how to obtain a running time of $O(m)$ if all edges that are not incident to $s$ or $t$ have capacity 1 .

\section*{Problem 3}
(Exercise 4, Chapter 8 from the book of Korte \& Vygen) A circulation is an $s-t$ flow with the extra property that the excess at $s$ and $t$ is 0 . Prove Hoffman's circulation theorem: Given a digraph $D(V, A)$ and lower and upper capacities $l, u: E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$with $l(a) \leq u(a)$ for all $a \in A$, there is circulation $f$ with $l(a) \leq f(a) \leq u(a)$ for all $a \in E(G)$ if and only if

$$
\sum_{a \in \delta^{-}(X)} l(a) \leq \sum_{a \in \delta^{+}(X)} u(a) \quad \text { for all } X \subseteq V(G) .
$$

Note: Hoffman's circulation theorem in turn quite easily implies the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem (Hoffman [1960]).

\section*{Problem 4}
In this exercise, we see another modification of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm that improves its running time.

Given a network $D(V, A)$ where, without loss of generality, we assume all edge capacities $u$ are integers, a feasible flow $f$, and a parameter $\Delta$, define the $\Delta$-residual network as the residual network of $D(V, A)$ with respect to $f$, containing only the arcs with capacity at least $\Delta$. Let $D_{f}(\Delta)$ denote the $\Delta$-residual network. Let $m$ be the number of $\operatorname{arcs}$ of $D$. Consider the following algorithm to find the maximum flow:

\begin{verbatim}
Algorithm 1
    Initialize $f \leftarrow 0, \Delta \leftarrow 2^{\lfloor\log U\rfloor}$ where $U$ denote the large st arc capacity, $\Delta$-residual network $D_{f}(\Delta)$ with
    residual capacities $u_{f}(a) \geq \Delta$ for all $a \in D_{f}(\Delta)$
    while $\Delta \geq 1$ do
        while $D_{f}(\Delta)$ contains an ( $s-t$ )-path do
            Identify an $(s-t)$-path $P$ in $D_{f}(\Delta)$
            $f^{\star} \leftarrow \min _{a \in P} u_{f}(a)$
            Obtain new flow $f$ by augmenting $f^{\star}$ units of flow along $P$ and update $D_{f}(\Delta)$ and $u_{f}$
        $\Delta \leftarrow \Delta / 2$
    return flow $f$
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that upon termination, the algorithm outputs the maximum flow.
  \item We refer to a phase of the algorithm during which $\Delta$ remains constant as a scaling phase. Show that the algorithm terminates after $O(\log U)$ scaling phases.
  \item Let $f^{\prime}$ be the value of the flow at the end of a scaling phase for some fixed $\Delta$. Let $D_{f^{\prime}}$ be the residual network of $D(V, A)$ with respect to flow $f^{\prime}$. Prove that the capacity of the minimum cut i n $D_{f^{\prime}}$ is at most $m \Delta$.
  \item Show that the algorithm performs at most $2 m$ augmentations per scaling phase. Hint: Build on (c).
  \item Conclude that the total running time of the algorithm is $O\left(m^{2} \log U\right)$.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 5}
The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm by always choosing a shortest augmenting path in the residual network. Suppose instead that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm chooses a widest augmenting path: an augmenting path with the greatest residual capacity. Assume that $G=(V, E)$ is a flow network with source $s$ and sink $t$, that all capacities are integer, and that the largest capacity is $C$. In this problem, you will show that choosing a widest augmenting path results in at most $|E| \ln \left|f^{*}\right|$ augmentations to find a maximum flow $f^{*}$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show how to adjust Dijkstra's algorithm to find the widest augmenting path in the residual network.
  \item Show that a maximum flow in $G$ can be formed by successive flow augmentations along at most $|E|$ paths from $s$ to $t$.
  \item Given a flow $f$, argue that the residual network has an augmenting path $p$ with residual capacity $(p) \geq\left(\left|f^{*}\right|-|f|\right) /|E|$.
  \item Assuming that each augmenting path is a widest augmenting path, let $f_{i}$ be the flow after augmenting the flow by the $i$ th augmenting path, where $f_{0}$ has $f(u, v)=0$ for all edges $(u, v)$. Show that $\left|f^{*}\right|-\left|f_{i}\right| \leq\left|f^{*}\right|(1-1 /|E|)^{i}$.
  \item Show that $\left|f^{*}\right|-\left|f_{i}\right|<\left|f^{*}\right| e^{-i /|E|}$.
  \item Conclude that after the flow is augmented at most $|E| \ln \left|f^{*}\right|$ times, the flow is a maximum flow.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 6}
A path cover of a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ is a set $P$ of vertex-disjoint paths such that every vertex in $V$ is included in exactly one path in $P$. Paths may start and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. A minimum path cover of $G$ is a path cover containing the fewest possible paths.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum path cover of a directed acyclic graph $G=(V, E)$. (Assuming that $V=1,2, \ldots, n$, construct a flow network based on the graph $G^{\prime}=\left(V^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)$, where
\end{itemize}

$$
\begin{aligned}
V^{\prime} & =x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \cup y_{0}, y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n} \\
E^{\prime} & =\left(x_{0}, x_{i}\right) i \in V \cup\left(y_{i}, y_{0}\right) i \in V \cup\left(x_{i}, y_{j}\right)(i, j) \in E
\end{aligned}
$$

and run a maximum-flow algorithm.)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does your algorithm work for directed graphs that contain cycles? Explain.
\end{itemize}
